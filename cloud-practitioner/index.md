# AWS Cloud Practitioner Study Guide

Hello! Here I've organized my study materials to help with my AWS Cloud Practitioner certification process. This repository contains detailed notes and resources I've compiled to prepare for the exam.

## ðŸ“š My Study Materials

### [AWS AI Services](./ai.md)
Comprehensive guide to AWS AI and machine learning services including Amazon Q, Bedrock, SageMaker, and other AI-powered solutions. **In my view, this is one of the most important topics for the exam**, especially with AWS's focus on AI services in recent years.

### [AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)](./caf.md)
Deep dive into the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework and its 6 perspectives: Business, People, Governance, Platform, Security, and Operations. **I consider this fundamental for the exam** as it's frequently tested in Cloud Practitioner questions.

### [AWS Well-Architected Framework](./well-architected-framework.md)
The six pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework: Operational Excellence, Security, Reliability, Performance Efficiency, Cost Optimization, and Sustainability. **This is one of the topics where I have less knowledge for the exam**, so I focused heavily on documenting the key concepts that appear in Cloud Practitioner questions.

### [AWS Security and Optimization Tools](./tools.md)
Essential AWS tools for security and optimization including AWS Trusted Advisor, AWS Config, CloudTrail, and more. **Area I need to study more for the exam**, especially to understand when and how to use these tools as they appear frequently in Cloud Practitioner questions.

### [Exam Analysis and Practice](./exams.md)
Detailed analysis of AWS Cloud Practitioner exam questions, including wrong answers analysis, practice tests, and exam strategies. **Very important for the exam** for learning from mistakes and improving my test-taking approach.
